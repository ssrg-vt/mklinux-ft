 * This file defines hook entry points called by core code where
 * user tracing/debugging support might need to do something.  These
 * entry points are called tracehook_*().  Each hook declared below
 * has a detailed kerneldoc comment giving the context (locking et
 * al) from which it is called, and the meaning of its return value.
 *
 * Each function here typically has only one call site, so it is ok
 * to have some nontrivial tracehook_*() inlines.  In all cases, the
 * fast path when no tracing is enabled should be very short.
 *
 * The purpose of this file and the tracehook_* layer is to consolidate
 * the interface that the kernel core and arch code uses to enable any
 * user debugging or tracing facility (such as ptrace).  The interfaces
 * here are carefully documented so that maintainers of core and arch
 * code do not need to think about the implementation details of the
 * tracing facilities.  Likewise, maintainers of the tracing code do not
 * need to understand all the calling core or arch code in detail, just
 * documented circumstances of each call, such as locking conditions.
 *
 * If the calling core code changes so that locking is different, then
 * it is ok to change the interface documented here.  The maintainer of
 * core code changing should notify the maintainers of the tracing code
 * that they need to work out the change.
 *
 * Some tracehook_*() inlines take arguments that the current tracing
 * implementations might not necessarily use.  These function signatures
 * are chosen to pass in all the information that is on hand in the
 * caller and might conceivably be relevant to a tracer, so that the
 * core code won't have to be updated when tracing adds more features.
 * If a call site changes so that some of those parameters are no longer
 * already on hand without extra work, then the tracehook_* interface
 * can change so there is no make-work burden on the core code.  The
 * maintainer of core code changing should notify the maintainers of the
 * tracing code that they need to work out the change.
