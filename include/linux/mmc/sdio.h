  SDIO status in R5
  Type
	e : error bit
	s : status bit
	r : detected and set for the actual command response
	x : detected and set during command execution. the host must poll
            the card by sending status command in order to read these bits.
  Clear condition
	a : according to the card state
	b : always related to the previous command. Reception of
            a valid command will clear it (with a delay of one command)
	c : clear by read
