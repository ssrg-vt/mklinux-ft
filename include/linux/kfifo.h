/*
 * Howto porting drivers to the new generic fifo API:
 *
 * - Modify the declaration of the "struct kfifo *" object into a
 *   in-place "struct kfifo" object
 * - Init the in-place object with kfifo_alloc() or kfifo_init()
 *   Note: The address of the in-place "struct kfifo" object must be
 *   passed as the first argument to this functions
 * - Replace the use of __kfifo_put into kfifo_in and __kfifo_get
 *   into kfifo_out
 * - Replace the use of kfifo_put into kfifo_in_locked and kfifo_get
 *   into kfifo_out_locked
 *   Note: the spinlock pointer formerly passed to kfifo_init/kfifo_alloc
 *   must be passed now to the kfifo_in_locked and kfifo_out_locked
 *   as the last parameter.
 * - All formerly name __kfifo_* functions has been renamed into kfifo_*
