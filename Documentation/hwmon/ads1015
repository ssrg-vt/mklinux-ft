Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the Texas Instruments ADS1015.

This device is a 12-bit A-D converter with 4 inputs.

The inputs can be used single ended or in certain differential combinations.

The inputs can be exported to 8 sysfs input files in0_input - in7_input:
in0: Voltage over AIN0 and AIN1.
in1: Voltage over AIN0 and AIN3.
in2: Voltage over AIN1 and AIN3.
in3: Voltage over AIN2 and AIN3.
in4: Voltage over AIN0 and GND.
in5: Voltage over AIN1 and GND.
in6: Voltage over AIN2 and GND.
in7: Voltage over AIN3 and GND.

Which inputs are exported can be configured using platform data or devicetree.

By default all inputs are exported.

Platform Data
-------------

In linux/i2c/ads1015.h platform data is defined as:

struct ads1015_platform_data {
	unsigned int exported_channels;
};

exported_channels is a bitmask that specifies which inputs should be exported.

Example:
struct ads1015_platform_data data = {
	.exported_channels = (1 << 2) | (1 << 4)
};

In this case only in2_input and in4_input would be created.

Devicetree
----------

The ads1015 node may have an "exported-channels" property.
exported_channels is a bitmask that specifies which inputs should be exported.

Example:
ads1015@49 {
	compatible = "ti,ads1015";
	reg = <0x49>;
	exported-channels = < 0x14 >;
};

In this case only in2_input and in4_input would be created.
