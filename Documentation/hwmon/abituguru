Kernel driver abituguru
=======================

Supported chips:
  * Abit uGuru (Hardware Monitor part only)
    Prefix: 'abituguru'
    Addresses scanned: ISA 0x0E0
    Datasheet: Not available, this driver is based on reverse engineering.
	A "Datasheet" has been written based on the reverse engineering it
	should be available in the same dir as this file under the name
	abituguru-datasheet.

Authors:

	(Initial reverse engineering done by Olle Sandberg
	 <ollebull@gmail.com>)


Module Parameters
-----------------

* force: bool		Force detection. Note this parameter only causes the
			detection to be skipped, if the uGuru can't be read
			the module initialization (insmod) will still fail.
* fan_sensors: int	Tell the driver how many fan speed sensors there are
			on your motherboard. Default: 0 (autodetect).
* pwms: int		Tell the driver how many fan speed controls (fan
			pwms) your motherboard has. Default: 0 (autodetect).
* verbose: int		How verbose should the driver be? (0-3):
			   0 normal output
			   1 + verbose error reporting
			   2 + sensors type probing info\n"
			   3 + retryable error reporting
			Default: 2 (the driver is still in the testing phase)

Notice if you need any of the first three options above please insmod the
driver with verbose set to 3 and mail me <j.w.r.degoede@hhs.nl> the output of:
dmesg | grep abituguru


Description
-----------

This driver supports the hardware monitoring features of the Abit uGuru chip
found on Abit uGuru featuring motherboards (most modern Abit motherboards).

The uGuru chip in reality is a Winbond W83L950D in disguise (despite Abit
claiming it is "a new microprocessor designed by the ABIT Engineers").
Unfortunatly this doesn't help since the W83L950D is a generic
microcontroller with a custom Abit application running on it.

Despite Abit not releasing any information regarding the uGuru, Olle
Sandberg <ollebull@gmail.com> has managed to reverse engineer the sensor part
of the uGuru. Without his work this driver would not have been possible.

Known Issues
------------

The voltage and frequency control parts of the Abit uGuru are not supported.
