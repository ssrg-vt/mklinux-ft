* MDIO IO device

The MDIO is a bus to which the PHY devices are connected.  For each
device that exists on this bus, a child node should be created.  See
the definition of the PHY node below for an example of how to define
a PHY.

Required properties:
  - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
  - compatible : Should define the compatible device type for the
    mdio.  Currently, this is most likely to be "fsl,gianfar-mdio"

Example:

	mdio@24520 {
		reg = <24520 20>;
		compatible = "fsl,gianfar-mdio";

		ethernet-phy@0 {
			......
		};
	};


* Gianfar-compatible ethernet nodes

Required properties:

  - device_type : Should be "network"
  - model : Model of the device.  Can be "TSEC", "eTSEC", or "FEC"
  - compatible : Should be "gianfar"
  - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
  - mac-address : List of bytes representing the ethernet address of
    this controller
  - interrupts : <a b> where a is the interrupt number and b is a
    field that represents an encoding of the sense and level
    information for the interrupt.  This should be encoded based on
    the information in section 2) depending on the type of interrupt
    controller you have.
  - interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller that
    services interrupts for this device.
  - phy-handle : The phandle for the PHY connected to this ethernet
    controller.
  - fixed-link : <a b c d e> where a is emulated phy id - choose any,
    but unique to the all specified fixed-links, b is duplex - 0 half,
    1 full, c is link speed - d#10/d#100/d#1000, d is pause - 0 no
    pause, 1 pause, e is asym_pause - 0 no asym_pause, 1 asym_pause.

Recommended properties:

  - phy-connection-type : a string naming the controller/PHY interface type,
    i.e., "mii" (default), "rmii", "gmii", "rgmii", "rgmii-id", "sgmii",
    "tbi", or "rtbi".  This property is only really needed if the connection
    is of type "rgmii-id", as all other connection types are detected by
    hardware.


Example:
	ethernet@24000 {
		#size-cells = <0>;
		device_type = "network";
		model = "TSEC";
		compatible = "gianfar";
		reg = <24000 1000>;
		mac-address = [ 00 E0 0C 00 73 00 ];
		interrupts = <d 3 e 3 12 3>;
		interrupt-parent = <40000>;
		phy-handle = <2452000>
	};
