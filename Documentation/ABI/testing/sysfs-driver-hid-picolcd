Description:	Make it possible to switch the PicoLCD device between LCD
		(firmware) and bootloader (flasher) operation modes.

		Reading: returns list of available modes, the active mode being
		enclosed in brackets ('[' and ']')

		Writing: causes operation mode switch. Permitted values are
		the non-active mode names listed when read, optionally followed
		by a delay value expressed in ms.

		Note: when switching mode the current PicoLCD HID device gets
		disconnected and reconnects after above delay (default value
		is 5 seconds though this default should not be relied on).

Description:	Make it possible to adjust defio refresh rate.

		Reading: returns list of available refresh rates (expressed in Hz),
		the active refresh rate being enclosed in brackets ('[' and ']')

		Writing: accepts new refresh rate expressed in integer Hz
		within permitted rates.

		Note: As device can barely do 2 complete refreshes a second
		it only makes sense to adjust this value if only one or two
		tiles get changed and it's not appropriate to expect the application
		to flush it's tiny changes explicitely at higher than default rate.
