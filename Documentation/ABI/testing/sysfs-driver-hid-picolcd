Description:	Make it possible to switch the PicoLCD device between LCD
		(firmware) and bootloader (flasher) operation modes.

		Reading: returns list of available modes, the active mode being
		enclosed in brackets ('[' and ']')

		Writing: causes operation mode switch. Permitted values are
		the non-active mode names listed when read, optionally followed
		by a delay value expressed in ms.

		Note: when switching mode the current PicoLCD HID device gets
		disconnected and reconnects after above delay (default value
		is 5 seconds though this default should not be relied on).
