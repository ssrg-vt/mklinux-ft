Description:

Provide a place in sysfs for the backing_dev_info object.
This allows us to see and set the various BDI specific variables.

The <bdi> identifier can be either of the following:

MAJOR:MINOR

	Device number for block devices, or value of st_dev on
	non-block filesystems which provide their own BDI, such as NFS
	and FUSE.

default

	The default backing dev, used for non-block device backed
	filesystems which do not provide their own BDI.
