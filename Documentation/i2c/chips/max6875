Description
-----------

The MAXIM max6875 is a EEPROM-programmable power-supply sequencer/supervisor.
It provides timed outputs that can be used as a watchdog, if properly wired.
It also provides 512 bytes of user EEPROM.

At reset, the max6875 reads the configuration eeprom into its configuration
registers.  The chip then begins to operate according to the values in the
registers.

See the datasheet for details on how to program the EEPROM.


Sysfs entries
-------------

eeprom_user   - 512 bytes of user-defined EEPROM space. Only writable if
                allow_write was set and register 0x43 is 0.

eeprom_config - 70 bytes of config EEPROM. Note that changes will not get
                loaded into register space until a power cycle or device reset.

reg_config    - 70 bytes of register space. Any changes take affect immediately.


General Remarks
---------------

A typical application will require that the EEPROMs be programmed once and
never altered afterwards.
