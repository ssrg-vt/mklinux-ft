config CFG80211
        tristate "Improved wireless configuration API"

config WIRELESS_EXT
	bool "Wireless extensions"
	default n
	---help---
	  This option enables the legacy wireless extensions
	  (wireless network interface configuration via ioctls.)

	  Wireless extensions will be replaced by cfg80211 and
	  will be required only by legacy drivers that implement
	  wireless extension handlers.

	  Say N (if you can) unless you know you need wireless
	  extensions for external modules.

config NET_WIRELESS_RTNETLINK
	bool "Wireless Extension API over RtNetlink"
	depends on WIRELESS_EXT
	---help---
	  Support the Wireless Extension API over the RtNetlink socket
	  in addition to the traditional ioctl interface (selected above).

	  For now, few tools use this facility, but it might grow in the
	  future. The only downside is that it adds 4.5 kB to your kernel.
