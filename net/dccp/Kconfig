	  Datagram Congestion Control Protocol

	  From draft-ietf-dccp-spec-11 <http://www.icir.org/kohler/dcp/draft-ietf-dccp-spec-11.txt>.

	  The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a transport
	  protocol that implements bidirectional, unicast connections of
	  congestion-controlled, unreliable datagrams. It should be suitable
	  for use by applications such as streaming media, Internet telephony,
	  and on-line games

	  To compile this protocol support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called dccp.

	  If in doubt, say N.
