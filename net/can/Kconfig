	  Controller Area Network (CAN) is a slow (up to 1Mbit/s) serial
	  communications protocol which was developed by Bosch in
	  1991, mainly for automotive, but now widely used in marine
	  (NMEA2000), industrial, and medical applications.
	  More information on the CAN network protocol family PF_CAN
	  is contained in <Documentation/networking/can.txt>.

	  If you want CAN support you should say Y here and also to the
	  specific driver for your controller(s) below.

	---help---
	  The raw CAN protocol option offers access to the CAN bus via
	  the BSD socket API. You probably want to use the raw socket in
	  most cases where no higher level protocol is being used. The raw
	  socket has several filter options e.g. ID masking / error frames.
	  To receive/send raw CAN messages, use AF_CAN with protocol CAN_RAW.
