config NET_VENDOR_3COM
	bool "3Com devices"
	depends on ISA || EISA || MCA || PCI || PCMCIA
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about 3Com cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_3COM

config EL1
	tristate "3c501 \"EtherLink\" support"
	depends on ISA
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card of this type, say Y and read
	  the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  Also, consider buying a
	  new card, since the 3c501 is slow, broken, and obsolete: you will
	  have problems.  Some people suggest to ping ("man ping") a nearby
	  machine every minute ("man cron") when using this card.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called 3c501.

config EL3
	tristate "3c509/3c529 (MCA)/3c579 \"EtherLink III\" support"
	depends on (ISA || EISA || MCA)
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to the 3Com
	  EtherLinkIII series, say Y and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available
	  from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If your card is not working you may need to use the DOS
	  setup disk to disable Plug & Play mode, and to select the default
	  media type.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called 3c509.

config 3C515
	tristate "3c515 ISA \"Fast EtherLink\""
	depends on (ISA || EISA) && ISA_DMA_API
	---help---
	  If you have a 3Com ISA EtherLink XL "Corkscrew" 3c515 Fast Ethernet
	  network card, say Y and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called 3c515.

config PCMCIA_3C574
	tristate "3Com 3c574 PCMCIA support"
	depends on PCMCIA
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you intend to attach a 3Com 3c574 or compatible PCMCIA
	  (PC-card) Fast Ethernet card to your computer.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called 3c574_cs.  If unsure, say N.

config PCMCIA_3C589
	tristate "3Com 3c589 PCMCIA support"
	depends on PCMCIA
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you intend to attach a 3Com 3c589 or compatible PCMCIA
	  (PC-card) Ethernet card to your computer.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called 3c589_cs.  If unsure, say N.

config VORTEX
	tristate "3c590/3c900 series (592/595/597) \"Vortex/Boomerang\" support"
	depends on (PCI || EISA)
	select MII
	---help---
	  This option enables driver support for a large number of 10Mbps and
	  10/100Mbps EISA, PCI and PCMCIA 3Com network cards:

	  "Vortex"    (Fast EtherLink 3c590/3c592/3c595/3c597) EISA and PCI
	  "Boomerang" (EtherLink XL 3c900 or 3c905)            PCI
	  "Cyclone"   (3c540/3c900/3c905/3c980/3c575/3c656)    PCI and Cardbus
	  "Tornado"   (3c905)                                  PCI
	  "Hurricane" (3c555/3cSOHO)                           PCI

	  If you have such a card, say Y and read the Ethernet-HOWTO,
	  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. More
	  specific information is in
	  <file:Documentation/networking/vortex.txt> and in the comments at
	  the beginning of <file:drivers/net/3c59x.c>.

	  To compile this support as a module, choose M here.

config TYPHOON
	tristate "3cr990 series \"Typhoon\" support"
	depends on PCI
	select CRC32
	---help---
	  This option enables driver support for the 3cr990 series of cards:

	  3C990-TX, 3CR990-TX-95, 3CR990-TX-97, 3CR990-FX-95, 3CR990-FX-97,
	  3CR990SVR, 3CR990SVR95, 3CR990SVR97, 3CR990-FX-95 Server,
	  3CR990-FX-97 Server, 3C990B-TX-M, 3C990BSVR

	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card of this type, say Y and read
	  the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called typhoon.

config ACENIC
	tristate "Alteon AceNIC/3Com 3C985/NetGear GA620 Gigabit support"
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you have an Alteon AceNIC, 3Com 3C985(B), NetGear
	  GA620, SGI Gigabit or Farallon PN9000-SX PCI Gigabit Ethernet
	  adapter. The driver allows for using the Jumbo Frame option (9000
	  bytes/frame) however it requires that your switches can handle this
	  as well. To enable Jumbo Frames, add `mtu 9000' to your ifconfig
	  line.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called acenic.

config ACENIC_OMIT_TIGON_I
	bool "Omit support for old Tigon I based AceNICs"
	depends on ACENIC
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you only have Tigon II based AceNICs and want to leave
	  out support for the older Tigon I based cards which are no longer
	  being sold (ie. the original Alteon AceNIC and 3Com 3C985 (non B
	  version)).  This will reduce the size of the driver object by
	  app. 100KB.  If you are not sure whether your card is a Tigon I or a
	  Tigon II, say N here.

	  The safe and default value for this is N.
