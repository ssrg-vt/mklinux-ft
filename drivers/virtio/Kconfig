	  This drivers provides support for virtio based paravirtual device
	  drivers over PCI.  This requires that your VMM has appropriate PCI
	  virtio backends.  Most QEMU based VMMs should support these devices
	  (like KVM or Xen).

	  Currently, the ABI is not considered stable so there is no guarantee
	  that this version of the driver will work with your VMM.

	  If unsure, say M.
