config HW_RANDOM
	bool "Hardware Random Number Generator Core support"
	default y
	---help---
	  Hardware Random Number Generator Core infrastructure.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config HW_RANDOM_INTEL
	tristate "Intel HW Random Number Generator support"
	depends on HW_RANDOM && (X86 || IA64) && PCI
	default y
	---help---
	  This driver provides kernel-side support for the Random Number
	  Generator hardware found on Intel i8xx-based motherboards.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called intel-rng.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config HW_RANDOM_AMD
	tristate "AMD HW Random Number Generator support"
	depends on HW_RANDOM && X86 && PCI
	default y
	---help---
	  This driver provides kernel-side support for the Random Number
	  Generator hardware found on AMD 76x-based motherboards.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called amd-rng.

	  If unsure, say Y.
