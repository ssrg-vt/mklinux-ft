	  Enable this to allow the userspace driver core code to be
	  built.  This code allows userspace programs easy access to
	  kernel interrupts and memory locations, allowing some drivers
	  to be written in userspace.  Note that a small kernel driver
	  is also required for interrupt handling to work properly.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say N.
