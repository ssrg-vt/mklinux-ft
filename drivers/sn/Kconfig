config SGI_IOC4

	default m
	---help---
	This option enables basic support for the IOC4 chip on certain
	SGI IO controller cards (IO9, IO10, and PCI-RT).  This option
	does not enable any specific functions on such a card, but provides
	necessary infrastructure for other drivers to utilize.

	If you have an SGI Altix with an IOC4-based card say Y.
	Otherwise say N.

config SGI_IOC3
	tristate "SGI IOC3 Base IO support"
	default m
	---help---
	This option enables basic support for the SGI IOC3-based Base IO
	controller card.  This option does not enable any specific
	functions on such a card, but provides necessary infrastructure
	for other drivers to utilize.

	If you have an SGI Altix with an IOC3-based
	I/O controller or a PCI IOC3 serial card say Y.
	Otherwise say N.
