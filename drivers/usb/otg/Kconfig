	  If you say yes here you get support for the Philips ISP1301
	  USB-On-The-Go transceiver working with the OMAP OTG controller.
	  The ISP1301 is a full speed USB  transceiver which is used in
	  products including H2, H3, and H4 development boards for Texas
	  Instruments OMAP processors.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called isp1301_omap.
