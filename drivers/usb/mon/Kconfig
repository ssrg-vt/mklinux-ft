	  If you say Y here, a component which captures the USB traffic
	  between peripheral-specific drivers and HC drivers will be built.
	  The USB_MON is similar in spirit and may be compatible with Dave
	  Harding's USBMon.

	  This is somewhat experimental at this time, but it should be safe,
	  as long as you aren't using modular USB and try to remove this
	  module.
