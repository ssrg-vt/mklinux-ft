config VIDEO_DEV

	  Support for audio/video capture and overlay devices and FM radio
	  cards. The exact capabilities of each device vary.

	  This kernel includes support for the new Video for Linux Two API,
	  (V4L2) as well as the original system. Drivers and applications
	  need to be rewritten to use V4L2, but drivers for popular cards
	  and applications for most video capture functions already exist.

	  Additional info and docs are available on the web at
	  <http://linuxtv.org>

	  Documentation for V4L2 is also available on the web at
	  <http://bytesex.org/v4l/>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called videodev.

	---help---
	  Enables a compatibility API used by most V4L2 devices to allow
	  its usage with legacy applications that supports only V4L1 api.

	  If you are unsure as to whether this is required, answer Y.

config VIDEO_V4L1_COMPAT
	bool "Enable Video For Linux API 1 compatible Layer"
	depends on VIDEO_DEV
	default VIDEO_DEV
	---help---
	  This api were developed to be used at Kernel 2.2 and 2.4, but
	  lacks support for several video standards. There are several
	  drivers at kernel that still depends on it.

	  Documentation for the original API is included in the file
	  <Documentation/video4linux/API.html>.

	  User tools for this are available from
	  <ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/video4linux/>.

	  Support Digital Video Broadcasting hardware.  Enable this if you
	  own a DVB adapter and want to use it or if you compile Linux for
	  a digital SetTopBox.

	  DVB core utility functions for device handling, software fallbacks etc.
	  Say Y when you have a DVB card and want to use it. Say Y if your want
	  to build your drivers outside the kernel, but need the DVB core. All
	  in-kernel drivers will select this automatically if needed.

	  API specs and user tools are available from <http://www.linuxtv.org/>.

	  Please report problems regarding this driver to the LinuxDVB
	  mailing list.

	  If unsure say N.
