	  Support for DVB receivers from Digital Everywhere, known as FireDTV
	  and FloppyDTV, which are connected via IEEE 1394 (FireWire).

	  These devices don't have an MPEG decoder built in, so you need
	  an external software decoder to watch TV.

	  To compile this driver as a module, say M here: the module will be
	  called firedtv.
