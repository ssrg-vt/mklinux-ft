config RTC_CLASS
	tristate "RTC class"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	default n
	select RTC_LIB
	help
	  Generic RTC class support. If you say yes here, you will
 	  be allowed to plug one or more RTCs to your system. You will
	  probably want to enable one of more of the interfaces below.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-class.

config RTC_HCTOSYS
	bool "Set system time from RTC on startup"
	depends on RTC_CLASS = y
	default y
	help
	  If you say yes here, the system time will be set using
	  the value read from the specified RTC device. This is useful
	  in order to avoid unnecessary fschk runs.

config RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE
	string "The RTC to read the time from"
	depends on RTC_HCTOSYS = y
	default "rtc0"
	help
	  The RTC device that will be used as the source for
	  the system time, usually rtc0.

config RTC_INTF_SYSFS
	tristate "sysfs"
	depends on RTC_CLASS && SYSFS
	default RTC_CLASS
	help
	  Say yes here if you want to use your RTC using the sysfs
	  interface, /sys/class/rtc/rtcX .

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-sysfs.

config RTC_INTF_PROC
	tristate "proc"
	depends on RTC_CLASS && PROC_FS
	default RTC_CLASS
	help
	  Say yes here if you want to use your RTC using the proc
	  interface, /proc/driver/rtc .

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-proc.

config RTC_INTF_DEV
	tristate "dev"
	depends on RTC_CLASS
	default RTC_CLASS
	help
	  Say yes here if you want to use your RTC using the dev
	  interface, /dev/rtc .

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-dev.

comment "RTC drivers"
	depends on RTC_CLASS

config RTC_DRV_X1205
	tristate "Xicor/Intersil X1205"
	depends on RTC_CLASS && I2C
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the
	  Xicor/Intersil X1205 RTC chip.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-x1205.

config RTC_DRV_DS1672
	tristate "Dallas/Maxim DS1672"
	depends on RTC_CLASS && I2C
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the
	  Dallas/Maxim DS1672 timekeeping chip.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-ds1672.

config RTC_DRV_TEST
	tristate "Test driver/device"
	depends on RTC_CLASS
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the
	  RTC test driver. It's a software RTC which can be
	  used to test the RTC subsystem APIs. It gets
	  the time from the system clock.
	  You want this driver only if you are doing development
	  on the RTC subsystem. Please read the source code
	  for further details.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-test.
