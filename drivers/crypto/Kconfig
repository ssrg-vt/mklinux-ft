	  Some VIA processors come with an integrated crypto engine
	  (so called VIA PadLock ACE, Advanced Cryptography Engine)
	  that provides instructions for very fast cryptographic
	  operations with supported algorithms.
	  
	  The instructions are used only when the CPU supports them.
	  Otherwise software encryption is used. If you are unsure,
	  say Y.

config CRYPTO_DEV_PADLOCK_AES

	default m
	help
	  Use VIA PadLock for AES algorithm.

	  Available in VIA C3 and newer CPUs.

	  If unsure say M. The compiled module will be
	  called padlock-aes.ko
