This is a driver for the ET1310 network device.

Based on the driver found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/et131x/

Cleaned up immensely by Olaf Hartman <o.hartmann@telovital.com> and Christoph
Hellwig <hch@infradead.org>

Note, the powermanagement options were removed from the vendor provided
driver as they did not build properly at the time.

TODO:
	- Implement a few more kernel Parameter (set mac )

Please send patches to:
	Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>
	Mark Einon <mark.einon@gmail.com>

And Cc: Olaf Hartmann <o.hartmann@telovital.com> as he has this device and can
test any changes.
