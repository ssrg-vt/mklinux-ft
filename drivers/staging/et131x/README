This is a driver for the ET1310 network device.

Based on the driver found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/et131x/

Cleaned up immensely by Olaf Hartman and Christoph Hellwig <hch@infradead.org>

Note, the powermanagement options were removed from the vendor provided
driver as they did not build properly at the time.

TODO:
	- rx_ring.fbr{0, 1} can probably share a common structure
	- Use of kmem_cache seems a bit unusual
	- Use dma_alloc_... in place of pci_alloc_...
	- It's too late stopping the tx queue when there is no room for the current packet. The condition should be detected for the next packet.
	- PCI_VDEVICE ?
