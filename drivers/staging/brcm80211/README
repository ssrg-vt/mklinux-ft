/lib/firmware/brcm (or wherever firmware is normally installed on your system).

Currently supported chips
==============
PCI
Name		Device ID
BCM4313		0x4727
BCM43224	0x4353
BCM43225	0x4357


Bugs/Problems
==============
- Driver can get confused while scanning during high throughput, can cause
  burping, hanging, and possible crashing.
- Occasional hangs & burps with BCM43224 on 2.4 GHz with dual stream rates.
- Occasional crashes with BCM43224 on multicore machines.


Broadcom fullmac driver

This is production driver.

What's here
