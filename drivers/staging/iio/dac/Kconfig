config AD5624R_SPI
	tristate "Analog Devices AD5624/44/64R DAC spi driver"
	depends on SPI
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices AD5624R, AD5644R and
	  AD5664R convertors (DAC). This driver uses the common SPI interface.

config AD5446
	tristate "Analog Devices AD5444/6, AD5620/40/60 and AD5541A/12A DAC SPI driver"
	depends on SPI
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices AD5444, AD5446,
	  AD5620, AD5640, AD5660 and AD5541A, AD5512A DACs.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ad5446.

config MAX517
	tristate "Maxim MAX517/518/519 DAC driver"
	depends on I2C && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the Maxim chips MAX517,
	  MAX518 and MAX519 (I2C 8-Bit DACs with rail-to-rail outputs).

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called max517.
