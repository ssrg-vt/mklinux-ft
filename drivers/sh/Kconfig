	  This enables support for hardware-assisted userspace hardirq
	  masking.

	  SH-4A and newer interrupt blocks all support a special shadowed
	  page with all non-masking registers obscured when mapped in to
	  userspace. This is primarily for use by userspace device
	  drivers that are using special priority levels.

	  If in doubt, say N.
