TODO

Divide into multiple files arch dep and not arch dep two layers:
 (1) one with the programming interface
 (2) one with the low level interface (can be plugged to anything) - in this case we provide ring buffer
     - but why don't provide multiple ring buffers?!

UPPER LAYER:
generic chunking (any low layer can need chunking/buffering)

LOWER LAYER:
send an MTU (like the eth board)     
     
multiple ring buffers between different kernels 

multicast

kernels as entities

processes (or services) as entity

ticketing and group ticketing - we can do as max chuncks so that

multiple channels: high prio - for the messaging layer itself; normal prio - for any other service
