/*
 * This file contains all of the powerdomains that have some element
 * of software control for the OMAP24xx and OMAP34XX chips.
 *
 * A few notes:
 *
 * This is not an exhaustive listing of powerdomains on the chips; only
 * powerdomains that can be controlled in software.
 *
 * A useful validation rule for struct powerdomain:
 * Any powerdomain referenced by a wkdep_srcs or sleepdep_srcs array
 * must have a dep_bit assigned.  So wkdep_srcs/sleepdep_srcs are really
 * just software-controllable dependencies.  Non-software-controllable
 * dependencies do exist, but they are not encoded below (yet).
 *
 * 24xx does not support programmable sleep dependencies (SLEEPDEP)
 *

/*
 * The names for the DSP/IVA2 powerdomains are confusing.
 *
 * Most OMAP chips have an on-board DSP.
 *
 * On the 2420, this is a 'C55 DSP called, simply, the DSP.  Its
 * powerdomain is called the "DSP power domain."  On the 2430, the
 * on-board DSP is a 'C64 DSP, now called the IVA2 or IVA2.1.  Its
 * powerdomain is still called the "DSP power domain."	On the 3430,
 * the DSP is a 'C64 DSP like the 2430, also known as the IVA2; but
 * its powerdomain is now called the "IVA2 power domain."
 *
 * The 2420 also has something called the IVA, which is a separate ARM
 * core, and has nothing to do with the DSP/IVA2.
 *
 * Ideally the DSP/IVA2 could just be the same powerdomain, but the PRCM
 * address offset is different between the C55 and C64 DSPs.
 *
 * The overly-specific dep_bit names are due to a bit name collision
 * with CM_FCLKEN_{DSP,IVA2}.  The DSP/IVA2 PM_WKDEP and CM_SLEEPDEP shift
 * value are the same for all powerdomains: 2
 */

/*
 * XXX should dep_bit be a mask, so we can test to see if it is 0 as a
 * sanity check?
 * XXX encode hardware fixed wakeup dependencies -- esp. for 3430 CORE
