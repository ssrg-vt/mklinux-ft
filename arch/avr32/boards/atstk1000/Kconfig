config BOARD_ATSTK1002_CUSTOM
	bool "Non-default STK-1002 jumper settings"
	help
	  You will normally leave the jumpers on the CPU card at their
	  default settings.  If you need to use certain peripherals,
	  you will need to change some of those jumpers.

if BOARD_ATSTK1002_CUSTOM

config BOARD_ATSTK1002_SW1_CUSTOM
	bool "SW1: use SSC1 (not SPI0)"
	help
	  This also prevents using the external DAC as an audio interface,
	  and means you can't initialize the on-board QVGA display.

config BOARD_ATSTK1002_SW2_CUSTOM
	bool "SW2: use IRDA or TIMER0 (not UART-A, MMC/SD, and PS2-A)"
	help
	  If you change this you'll want an updated boot loader putting
	  the console on UART-C not UART-A.

config BOARD_ATSTK1002_SW3_CUSTOM
	bool "SW3: use TIMER1 (not SSC0 and GCLK)"
	help
	  This also prevents using the external DAC as an audio interface.

config BOARD_ATSTK1002_SW4_CUSTOM
	bool "SW4: use ISI/Camera (not GPIOs, SPI1, and PS2-B)"
	help
	  To use the camera interface you'll need a custom card (on the
	  PCI-format connector) connect a video sensor.

config BOARD_ATSTK1002_SW5_CUSTOM
	bool "SW5: use MACB1 (not LCDC)"

config BOARD_ATSTK1002_SW6_CUSTOM
	bool "SW6: more GPIOs (not MACB0)"

endif	# custom

config BOARD_ATSTK1002_SPI1
	bool "Configure SPI1 controller"
	depends on !BOARD_ATSTK1002_SW4_CUSTOM
	help
	  All the signals for the second SPI controller are available on
	  GPIO lines and accessed through the J1 jumper block.  Say "y"
	  here to configure that SPI controller.
