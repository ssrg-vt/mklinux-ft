config OPROFILE
	tristate "OProfile system profiling (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PROFILING
	depends on HAVE_OPROFILE
	help
	  OProfile is a profiling system capable of profiling the
	  whole system, include the kernel, kernel modules, libraries,
	  and applications.

	  If unsure, say N.

config OPROFILE_IBS
	bool "OProfile AMD IBS support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	default n
	depends on OPROFILE && SMP && X86
	help
          Instruction-Based Sampling (IBS) is a new profiling
          technique that provides rich, precise program performance
          information. IBS is introduced by AMD Family10h processors
          (AMD Opteron Quad-Core processor “Barcelona”) to overcome
          the limitations of conventional performance counter
          sampling.

	  If unsure, say N.

config HAVE_OPROFILE
	def_bool n

config KPROBES
	bool "Kprobes"
	depends on KALLSYMS && MODULES
	depends on HAVE_KPROBES
	help
	  Kprobes allows you to trap at almost any kernel address and
	  execute a callback function.  register_kprobe() establishes
	  a probepoint and specifies the callback.  Kprobes is useful
	  for kernel debugging, non-intrusive instrumentation and testing.
	  If in doubt, say "N".

config HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS
	def_bool n
	help
	  Some architectures are unable to perform unaligned accesses
	  without the use of get_unaligned/put_unaligned. Others are
	  unable to perform such accesses efficiently (e.g. trap on
	  unaligned access and require fixing it up in the exception
	  handler.)

	  This symbol should be selected by an architecture if it can
	  perform unaligned accesses efficiently to allow different
	  code paths to be selected for these cases. Some network
	  drivers, for example, could opt to not fix up alignment
	  problems with received packets if doing so would not help
	  much.

	  See Documentation/unaligned-memory-access.txt for more
	  information on the topic of unaligned memory accesses.

config KRETPROBES
	def_bool y
	depends on KPROBES && HAVE_KRETPROBES

config HAVE_IOREMAP_PROT
	def_bool n

config HAVE_KPROBES
	def_bool n

config HAVE_KRETPROBES
	def_bool n

config HAVE_DMA_ATTRS
	def_bool n

config USE_GENERIC_SMP_HELPERS
	def_bool n

config HAVE_CLK
	def_bool n
	help
	  The <linux/clk.h> calls support software clock gating and
	  thus are a key power management tool on many systems.
